**📊 Social Media Audience Analytics Dashboard – Power BI**
🎯 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing social media engagement data to understand audience behavior and identify key drivers of engagement such as likes, shares, comments, and video views.

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that helps marketing teams and content strategists visualize engagement across demographics, hobbies, professions, and countries — enabling smarter, data-driven content decisions.

🧩 Key Features

Demographic Filters: Interactive slicers for Gender, Hobby, and Profession for audience segmentation.

Hobby-Based Insights: Clustered column charts comparing engagement across different hobbies.

Geographic Analysis: Field map highlighting engagement distribution by country.

Demographic Visualization: Donut charts and histograms for analyzing gender and age distribution.

User-Level Insights: Identified top-engaging users based on comment and share activity.

💡 Key Insights
